**Gauss Games - A new flexible TTRPG System**

Are you ready to shape something new and different? We’re creating a brand-new tabletop RPG system designed to explore a
sweet spot between the Gamer, Simulationist and Narrativist positions with a modern storytelling vibe, blending elements of **OSR** and narrative play styles.

### What We’re Building
- **A Narrative System That Fits You:** We want players to feel like they’re not just moving pieces on a chessboard, but true co-creators of the
story.
- **Character Creation Without Limits:** Build characters that feel alive, with depth and purpose, whether you’re a grizzled veteran or a
freshly minted hero.
- **A System That Respects Your Time:** No need to pore over complicated rules. Simple, elegant mechanics that let you focus on the magic of
storytelling.
- **Rules that work in multiple settings.** A rules system which has per-campaign knobs which allow you turn up or down the fantasy level.

### Why do we have Github ?
Tabletop RPGs, right? So why a GitHub account that's for software?

Gauss Games are proud supporters of Open Source in Computing and will be offering software tools to support their
game system when it is released. In the meantime, this space allows the developers on the team to cooperate
and share access to tools.

### Status
The Gauss Games system is currently in an early playtest phase. Only those involved in the playtest have access to the repositories in this organisation.
